# Purpose

Drinks Я US is an application that is designed to find your Cocktail by: Alcohol, Ingredients, or Cocktail Name. Designed for people on the move looking for a quick way to access information on how to make their favorite cocktail. We have also provided nutritional facts about the cocktail of their choice. We have provided a search based on what ingredients you might have at your consumption, making your decision of cocktail choice much easier.

# Original Idea

\
The idea originally began with Bennett Stokes. He was interested in creating an NBA player statistically experience, however due to time and ambition of the project we decided as a group to transition to a Cocktail Drink Search. This corresponded well with a project that required a CSS framework, being interactive, using at least two API calls, use of client-side storage to store persistent data, integration, and a polished UI. We were able as a team to overcome certain challenges and be very agile in our decision making process. We had fun and created an enjoyable user experience for the application.

# IceBox

\
There are several ideas pending for possible future development.

1) A location finder for nearby Bars, Restaurants, Grocery Stores to find your Cocktail or Alcohol ASAP.
2) Adding a 'Notes' feature to the "Cocktails Details Page".
3) Allowing for a "Saved Favorites" to create a list for the user.
